**Analogue** is a flexible, easy-to-use **Data Mapper ORM** for **PHP**. It provides a quick and intuitive way to query and persist custom domain objects into a SQL Database. 

The project started as a fork from **Eloquent** by *Taylor Otwell*, and evolved into a fully featured Data Mapper, that sits on top of the very robust **Laravel Database** component. That said, **Analogue** is able to peacefuly coexists with its cousin in a same application *(only limitation is you cannot have relationships between the two, which is a common moraly accepted behaviour in the same family...)*

Analogue can be used as a **standalone package**, or can be transparently integrated into Laravel via a dedicated ServiceProvider.

If you're already familiar with Eloquent, a lot of the syntax is similar, so you should be up and running in no time. In fact, you may probably **gain time** as Analogue leverage some heavy DB tasks as **synchronizing complex relationships**., letting you think in term of **objects** and **collections** instead.

```php
$files = $filesystem->files('/path/to/gallery');

$gallery = new Gallery('Trip to India');

foreach($files as $file)
{
    $photo = new Photo($file);
    $gallery->addPhoto($photo);
}

$mapper->store($gallery);

```

If you intend to build applications following the **DDD** approach, **Analogue** can be a great asset for you.
